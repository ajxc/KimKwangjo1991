	All the retroflex words have a labialized PR variant /-waŋ/, which
agrees with Modern Mandarin. The initial /ɱ/ is still distinct from /w/ in
LR which represents the actual speech of the mid-fifteenth century, but 
merged into /w/ in RR which reflects the actual speech of the 
early-sixteenth century¹⁾.
