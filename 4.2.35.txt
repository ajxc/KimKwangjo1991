	The labiodental words except for /ɱ/ have the delabialized variant PR
/-an/. SR /ɱwan/ in the mid-fifteenth century must have already evolved
into /wan/ in actual speech by the early sixteenth century. Viewed from the
PR's of other labiodental words, the process of change would be as follows:
ɱwan > *ɱan > wan. Probably Ch`we Sejin kept SR and LR *ɱoan* as a compromise
between its original initial /ɱ/ and its actual phonemic value /wan/. If
/ɱwan/ or /ɱan/ still had existed in the early sixteenth century, its RR

also should have been *ɱoan* or *ɱan* because the RR transcription
differentiates /ɱ/ from /w/: however, its RR is *∅oan*. The initial /ŋ/ is
not distinct in PR.

	1. The *No Pak chimnam* gives a note for this word, saying that 還 in
phrases such as '還有' and '還要' may be pronounced like the reading of 孩
(SR *ping* /ʏaj/).
	2. This word occurrs only once. /ɱwan/ must be a misprint for /ʔwan/.
