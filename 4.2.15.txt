All the words listed in this SR final must have had a final /-jɨ(j)/
[i] in contemporary actual speech. The *Hongmu chông'un yôkhun* says that all
the words with this SR final have a PR final, /-jɨ/¹⁾. The general
illustrations of the *Sasông t`onghae* gives the following note for this SR
final: "The finals of the rime *zhi 支 /-ɨ/ and /-jɨ/ and that of the rime
*qi* 齊 /-jej/, seemingly, can be combined, but I have differentiated them.
However, the words with the final /-jɨ/ and the popular reading of the rime
*qi* are confused and there is no distinction. Can we distinguish them from
each other? The *Yunxue jicheng* 韻學集成 mixes them up and the *Zhongzhou
yinyun* 中州音韻 also makes the final /-ɨ/ one rime and the final /-jɨ/ one
rime. Now, I also should make the final /-ɨ/ of the rime *zhi* one rime, and
the final /-jɨ/ (of the rime *zhi*) and the rime *qi* one rime, so that sounds
and finals can be clearly understood." And the note for SR final /-jej/ in
the *Sasông t`onghae* testifies the following: "The final /-jej/ in all cases

	1. The *pingsheng* part of this rime is missing in the *Hongmu chông'un
yôkhun*. In the first SR entry, which is /tsjej/, of the *qusheng* rime,
its note says: "the popular reading is /tsjɨ/. All the words in the rime have
the same final. Explanation is seen in the *pingsheng* rime *qi* 齊." The note
for the first SR entry of the *shangsheng* has a basically same content but
its popular reading is erased.

is pronounced /-jɨ/ in the current practice. For instance, '鷄' /kjej/ is
/kjɨ/. Now, all of them follow this practice." Only the final /-jɨ/ appears
in LR and RR, too.
