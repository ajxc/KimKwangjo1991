	The note for the *rusheng* final in the *Sasông t`onghae* says: "All (the
words) are pronounced /-jwɔ/ in the current practice." LR generally
reflects /-jawʔ/ which may be said to be an earleir form of the Modern
Mandarin colloquial readings, /-jaw/ or /-aw/, but RR, /-jwɔ/, an earlier
form of the Modern Mandarin literary readings /-jwe/ or /-we/. The initial
/ŋ/ is not distinct in PR.
