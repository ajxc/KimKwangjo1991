	The note for the final in the *Sasông t`onghae* says that in the current
popular reading, some words in *ping*, *shang* or *qu* tone follow /-an/, some,
/-jen/ and some, the original sound (i.e., /-jan/). The *Hongmu chông'un
yôkhun* gives the note that PR for this final is /-jan/. However, /-jen/ is
prevailing in CPR, LR and RR except for two words 嵌 and 饀. This means
that /-jam/ evolved into /-jan/ by the mid-fifteenth century and then
probably further into /-jen/ in the early sixteenth century. The initial
/ŋ/ is not distinct in PR. The following is the list of especially recorded
PR's, CPR's, LR's and RR's in the *Sasông t`onghae* and the *Pônyôk*.

	1. Of a total of five occurrences, /k`jan/ occupies four, and /k`jen/,
one.
	2. This word occurrs only once. Is it is misprint for /ʏjan/ or an
evidence of synchronic coexistence of /-m/ and /-n/ endings in the actual
speech of the mid-fifteenth century?
