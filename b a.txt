Conventions and Abbreviations

	All the forms, both phonetic and phonemic, are expressed in the
International Phonetic Alpabet (IPA). In addition, to represent two apical
vowels of Chinese, dental and retroflex, the notations [ɿ] and [ʅ ] are
added in accordance with general practice in Chinese phonetics. Karlgren's
Ancient Chinese (=our Middle Chinese) forms are also given in IPA.
	Transliterations of Korean alphabets are in accordance with my own
system discussed in Chapter Two. They are underlined to differentiate them
from other phonetic notations. Korean names are nornally given in
MacCune-Reischauer ronanization.
	Modern Mandarin forms, both phonetic and phonemic, are given in IPA as
described in Chapter One. When citing Chinese names, they are given in
*pinyin* romanization. Other Chinese dialect forms are also given in IPA as
found in such sources as the *Hanyu fangyin zihui* (1962).
	Japanese words are given in Hepburn romanization with the addition of
*kana* spellings where necessary.
Square brackets [] are used to express phonetic forms. Slashes // are
used to make clear that a form is a phonemicization. Parentheses () are
sonetines used to give a supplerentary infornation. Book titles are
underlined.
