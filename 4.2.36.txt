	All the words with a initial /m/ and 篷 (SR *ping* /bwɨng/) have a
delabialized CPR variant /-ɨŋ/, which may be considered forerunners of
delabialization of labial words. Eventually, /-wɨŋ/ with a labial initial
have evolved into /-ɨŋ/ in Modern Mandarin.

	1. This word has an interesting note: "In my humble opinion, the word
'奉' must have had a voiced initial (i.e., /v/). Therefore, the *Guyin* 古音
"Old Readings" lists it under the initial /v/. It is a mistake that the
*Hongwu zengyun* placed it under the word '捧' whose initial is /f/.
Futhermore, '奉' in a phrase '奉天殿' is read with *qusheng* in the current
practice. Its reading in the *Zhongyuan yinyun* is the same as the reading of
'鳳'. Now, it should be read with a voiced initial."
