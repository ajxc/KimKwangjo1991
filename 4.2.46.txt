	1. This PR is based on the *Hongmu chông'un yôkhun*. The PR in the
*Sasông t`onghae* accidentally fails to include this word and the next word
朋.
	2. The *Sasông t`onghae* specifies the usage of this CPR in the sense of
'watch-hour' such as in '更漏'.
	3. This word is also listed under SR *ping* /ʏjɨŋ/ with PR /ʏɨŋ/.
