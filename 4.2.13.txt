All the labial words have PR /-ɨj/. The words 內 and 累 have CPR /nɨj/
and /lɨj/, respectively, which can be considered forerunners of the change
/wɨj/ > /ɨj/ in these initial categories. It is curious, however, that
these CPR's are not reflected in RR of the *Pônyôk*. It is not until the
eighteenth century that /lwɨj/ and /nwɨj/ in all tones evolved into /lɨj/
and /nɨj/, respectively. (For details ,see Chapter Five 5.3.1.1

"Delabialization".) Most of the guttural *rusheng* words have a variant
reading /-wɔʔ/ in PR and/or RR.

	1. Only one occurrence of /dzwɨj/ is found.
	2. These two words are also listed under SR *qu* /ʂwɨ/ with PR /ʂwajʔ/.
	3. The *No Pak chimnam* gives a note for this word: "'To give'. The word
originally has the intial /ɡ/, but in the popular practice, all follow the
initial /k/, *shangsheng*. People who read it with the original initial
(i.e., /ɡ/ may be one or two out of ten."
	4. This PR is not recorded in the *Hongmu chông'un yôkhun*.
	5. The same as the previous note.
	6. One out of a total of seven occurrences is transcribed /xwɨj/.
This might be a transcriptional mistake.
