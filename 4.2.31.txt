	The note for this final in the *Sasông t`onhae* says: "As for the middle
sound (i.e., the final without a consonantal ending) /ɔ/ of the *ping*, *shang*
and *qu* words, all the popular pronunciations and Mongol readings follow
[a]. Now, I also follow /a/. However, I do not record popular readings
under each word for the purpose of avoding complexity, unlike the *Sasông
t`onggo*." The *Hongmu chông'un yôkhun* records PR with a final /-an/ under
each homonym group. LR and RR also validate only /-an/. The initial /ŋ/ is
not distinct in PR. The following examples are the words which appear in
the *Pônyôk*.
