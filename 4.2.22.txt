	Almost all the *ru* words except for guttural one have RR /-wɔ/ in the
*Pônyôk*. Strangely, the *Sasông t`onghae* is quiet about this variant reading.
Most of retroflex *ru* words have PR /-wawʔ/, which may have already
developed a variant /-wɔʔ/. The *T`onghae* in the note of the SR final
/-wawʔ/ says that all the words with this final are pronounced /-wɔ(ʔ)/ in
CPR. And some guttural *ru* words have CPR and/or RR /-ɔ/. The initial /ŋ/
is not distinct in PR.

	1. Of a total of fourteen occurrences of 各, /kawʔ/ occupies nine. Of
a total of ten of 閣, /kawʔ/ occupies three. Curiously, /kawʔ/ occurs only
in the *Pônyôk No Gôltae* except for one occurrence of 各 /kɔʔ/, and /kɔʔ/ in
the *Pônyôk Pak T`ongsa*.
