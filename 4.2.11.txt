	1. This word is also listed under *ru* SR /ʔa/ with *shang* CPR /ʔwa/ and
*ping* SR /ʔjaw/ with *shang* CPR /ʔwa/.
	2. The SR for this word in the *Hongmu chông'un yôkhun* is *ɱat* with PR
*ɱaʔ* /ɱaʔ/. Because of the sound change, ɱaʔ > wa(ʔ), by Ch`we Sejin's
times, he changed the SR from *ɱat* to *ɱoa*. Probably, the transcription *ɱoa*
in SR and CPR is a compromise between its original initial /ɱ/ and its
actual contemporary pronunciation [wa]. Note that its RR is *∅oa* /wa/.
